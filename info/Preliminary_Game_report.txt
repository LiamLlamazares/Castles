This is the right mindset. If the researcher doesn't understand the "canvas" we are painting on (the Hex grid, the specific piece archetypes, the economy), they will give us generic advice. They need to know exactly what constraints and tools they are working with.
Here is the Comprehensive Research Brief. It includes a full "Game Overview" section that you can hand to anyone, and they will immediately understand the project.
Research Directive: Project "Castles" – Mechanics & Retention Analysis
Part 1: Project Overview (Context for the Researcher)
Game Title: "Castles"
Genre: Browser-based Turn-Based Strategy / Wargame.
Core Metaphor: "Chess meets Fantasy Warfare."
The Game Board & Pieces:
 * The Grid: The game is played on a Hexagonal Grid, allowing for 6-directional movement and complex flanking opportunities.
 * The Pieces: Unlike Chess, we use a fantasy roster with unique movement logics:
   * Monarch: The "King" (must be protected).
   * Heavy Hitters: Giants (Rook-like), Dragons (Flying/Heavy).
   * Specialists: Assassins (high mobility), Rangers (ranged attack), Phoenix (respawns).
 * Terrain:
   * The River: A central choke point that currently restricts movement.
   * Castles: Control points that allow the player to Recruit new pieces (Economy).
   * Sanctuaries: Secondary control points that summon unique units (e.g., Wolves, Wizards) or provide buffs.
The Core Loop:
 * Movement: Players move armies across the hex grid (tactical positioning).
 * Combat: Deterministic (Strength vs Strength). No dice rolls.
 * Economy: Holding Castles allows you to build more troops.
 * Victory: Capture the enemy Monarch OR Control all Castles.
The Design Challenge:
We have a solid tactical engine (the chess part). We are missing the "Hook"—the psychological stickiness found in modern games. We want to inject the excitement of Deck Building and Resource Conflict without adding frustrating randomness.
Part 2: Research Objectives
We need you to analyze the following games to understand why they are fun and how we can translate their mechanics into our Hex-Grid context.
1. Dune: Imperium (Conflict & Worker Placement)
 * The Context: Dune forces players to fight over specific board spaces to gain resources.
 * The Question: How does the game create tension around these spaces?
 * Application to Castles: We have "Sanctuaries." Currently, they just give you a unit.
   * Look for: How can we make our Sanctuaries feel like Dune board spaces? Should they provide global passive buffs (e.g., "Control the Fire Shrine to give all units +1 Attack") to force players to fight over them?
2. Magic: The Gathering (The "Hand" & Interaction)
 * The Context: MTG allows players to intervene during the opponent's turn (Instants/Flash) and creates tension through hidden information (cards in hand).
 * The Question: How does MTG make the player feel clever for holding onto a card?
 * Application to Castles: We are considering adding a "Hand of Tactics" (Spells/Items).
   * Look for: Mechanics that allow for "Bluffing" without breaking the deterministic nature of the board. How can we replicate the feeling of a "Trap Card" on a hex grid?
3. Burning Banners (The Command Scale)
 * The Context: A hex-and-counter wargame that uses a "Command Deck" to limit actions.
 * The Question: How does the card system prevent "Snowballing"? Does it force players to make tough choices about which part of the army to move?
 * Application to Castles: Currently, our players can move almost anything. Should we limit activation to make the game tighter?
4. General "Juice" (Hearthstone / Duelyst)
 * The Context: These games feel satisfying to touch and watch.
 * The Question: What specific audio-visual feedback makes a simple action (like attacking) feel powerful?
 * Application to Castles: We need a "Juice Menu." List 3 specific visual effects (e.g., screen shake, hit-stop, particle debris) that we should implement to make our combat feel heavy.
Part 3: The Synthesis (The Deliverable)
Do not just list mechanics. Propose "Fusion Concepts" for our game.
Example of what we are looking for:
> "Take the Conflict Cards from Dune: Imperium and apply them to the River Crossing. When a unit crosses the river, the player draws a 'Tactic Card' that gives a one-time bonus. This encourages aggression (crossing the river) and adds a layer of unpredictable strategy."
> 
We need 3 specific proposals on how to merge the Mechanics of these games into our Hex-Grid system to improve Replayability and Fun.
A Next Step for You
While the researcher is working, I noticed in your code that you already have getImageByPieceType and various SVG assets.
To prepare for the "Juice" that the researcher will recommend, would you like me to write a SoundManager and VFXController module?
 * I can set up the architecture so that when we decide what the juice is (e.g., "Dragon Roar" or "Screen Shake"), you can plug it in with one line of code: playSound('dragon_attack'). This is "plumbing" we will need regardless of the research outcome.


Here's my plan to tackle that topic. Let me know if you need to make changes.

Project "Castles": Mechanics & Retention Analysis – A Deep Dive into Hybrid Strategy Design1. Introduction: The Strategic Hybridization MandateProject "Castles" represents a burgeoning archetype in the modern strategy landscape: the deterministic tactical wargame infused with the psychological volatility of card-based resource management. The core metaphor, "Chess meets Fantasy Warfare," establishes a foundation of high agency and perfect information. However, the directive to introduce a "Hook" via deck-building and resource conflict reveals a critical design challenge: mediating the friction between the dry, calculable nature of hex-grid tactics and the dynamic, emotional highs of probabilistic mechanics.Retention in strategy games is rarely driven by the mechanical purity of movement; rather, it is sustained by the "agony of choice" and the visceral satisfaction of execution. To engineer this stickiness without introducing the frustration of output randomness (e.g., dice rolls determining damage), we must look to leaders in hybrid design. This report provides an exhaustive analysis of four mechanical pillars: the tension systems of Dune: Imperium, the hidden information dynamics of Magic: The Gathering (MTG), the logistical constraints of Burning Banners, and the sensory feedback loops ("Juice") of Hearthstone and Duelyst.The objective is to synthesize these elements into a cohesive system for Castles where "Sanctuaries" function as dynamic conflict zones, a "Hand of Tactics" introduces deterministic bluffing, and movement limitations naturally curb snowballing, all reinforced by a "Juice Menu" of high-fidelity audio-visual feedback.2. The Architecture of Tension: Lessons from Dune: ImperiumTo understand how to transform "Sanctuaries" from static buff nodes into engines of psychological stickiness, we must deconstruct the worker placement and conflict resolution systems of Dune: Imperium and its sequel, Uprising. The "Hook" in Dune is not the resource collection itself, but the excruciating tension created by the dual utility of every game component.2.1 The Opportunity Cost CrisisThe fundamental engine of tension in Dune: Imperium is the "Agent Turn" versus the "Reveal Turn." A player’s hand of cards represents their total potential for the round. Each card presents a binary, mutually exclusive choice: it can be used to send an Agent to a board space (triggering immediate tactical effects) or held for the Reveal phase (generating Persuasion to buy better cards and Combat Strength to win the conflict).1This mechanism ensures that every action carries an inherent opportunity cost. If a player uses their "Dagger" card to visit a Sietch and gain water, they inherently sacrifice the +1 Attack strength that card would have provided in the conflict. In Castles, this principle is paramount. A Sanctuary should not merely be a hex one occupies; it must require a commitment that weakens the player elsewhere. If holding a Sanctuary requires "exhausting" a heavy hitter or committing a Tactic card, the player is forced to weigh the immediate economic gain against the risk of military vulnerability.2.2 The Conflict as a Blind AuctionThe combat system in Dune: Imperium operates effectively as a blind auction where "Troops" are the currency and the "Conflict Card" is the lot. Unlike traditional wargames where combat is a means to eliminate enemy pieces, combat in Dune is a negotiation for victory points and resources.2.2.1 The "Concept of the Inch"Strategic retention is driven by the efficiency of wins. Snippets regarding high-level Dune play emphasize that the goal is not to dominate a conflict, but to win by the smallest possible margin—to "win by an inch".2 Over-committing troops to a battle leaves a player vulnerable in subsequent rounds. This creates a meta-game of bluffing and chicken; players will slowly commit resources, trying to force opponents to fold without expending their own high-value assets.In Castles, Sanctuaries should encourage this behavior. If a Sanctuary grants a massive buff, players will naturally throw everything at it. However, if the Sanctuary grants a scaling reward based on margin of victory or requires sustained commitment over time, players will attempt to hold it with the minimum viable force, creating openings for opponents to exploit.2.2.2 The Consolation Prize DynamicDune: Imperium – Uprising refines the conflict system by significantly boosting second and third-place rewards.4 In many strategy games, losing a battle is a total loss of investment. This leads to "defensive play" where players only fight battles they are guaranteed to win, which creates stagnation. By offering substantial rewards (e.g., Intrigue cards, resources) for second place, Dune incentivizes participation in battles a player knows they will lose.This is critical for Castles. If a player attacks a Sanctuary and fails to capture it, the "random frustration" is high. However, if the act of contesting the Sanctuary yields a minor reward (e.g., "Combat Experience" or a "Tactic Card"), the player feels that the aggression was not wasted. This retains engagement even in a losing position.2.3 Dynamic Geography: The Shield Wall and SandwormsUprising introduces a geographic evolution mechanic: the Shield Wall. The powerful "Sandworm" units (which double rewards) cannot be deployed into protected spaces until the Shield Wall is removed.5 This creates a narrative arc within the game session. Early game geography is restrictive; late-game geography is open and volatile.For Castles, this suggests that River choke points or Sanctuary access paths should not be static. Perhaps early in the game, Rivers are impassable (Shield Wall), but later they freeze or bridges are built, opening up new vectors for heavy units (Sandworms) to dominate. This prevents the "solved state" problem in deterministic games where the optimal path is calculated on Turn 1.2.4 Implementation Strategy: The Sanctuary AuctionTo apply these findings to Castles, we propose treating Sanctuaries not as capture points, but as "Conflict Bids."FeatureDune: Imperium MechanicApplication to Castles SanctuaryCommitmentAgents block spaces; Troops go to bowl.Units occupy Hexes; "Supply" or "Cards" are committed to the hex.ResolutionEnd of Round Reveal.End of "Season" or specific Turn Count.RewardTiered (1st, 2nd, 3rd place).Tiered: Winner gets Buff/Summon; Loser gets Gold/Tactics.DynamicShield Wall blocks Worms."Magical Wards" block Heavy Hitters until Turn X.By adopting this structure, the Sanctuary becomes a source of tension ("Do I bid more supply?") rather than just a tactical puzzle ("Can I reach the hex?").3. The Mechanics of Deception: Adapting MTG & BattleCONThe second design objective is to adapt Magic: The Gathering's "Flash" mechanic to create a "Hand of Tactics" for bluffing. The challenge lies in translating the interrupt-driven nature of Flash (which relies on the "Stack") into a deterministic, turn-based environment without introducing the "random frustration" of drawing the wrong card at the wrong time.3.1 The Psychology of the "Open Mana"In Magic: The Gathering, the most powerful bluff is often doing nothing. A player with untapped islands and cards in hand exerts "virtual pressure" on the opponent.7 The opponent must respect the possibility of a counterspell or a flash creature (e.g., "Ambush Viper"), potentially taking a sub-optimal turn to avoid a devastating blowout.8This creates a "transfer of agency." In a purely deterministic game like Chess, the active player dictates the flow. In MTG, the defending player retains agency via Instants. The "Hook" is the psychological warfare of the unknown. The research indicates that Flash works best when it forces the opponent to question their own information.10 However, in MTG, this is mitigated by the randomness of the draw—you might simply not have the counterspell. In a deterministic game, we need a system that reduces draw variance while keeping the bluff.3.2 Deterministic Bluffing: The BattleCON SolutionBattleCON provides the perfect template for "deterministic bluffing." As a card-based fighting game, it uses simultaneous reveals and perfect information regarding opponents' discard piles.11The Mechanism: Players pair a "Base" (e.g., Strike) with a "Style" (e.g., Clockwork).The Bluff: Discards are public. If Player A knows Player B has played their "Dodge" card, Player A can safely attack. If "Dodge" is in hand, Player A must hesitate.Priority as Stack: BattleCON uses "Priority" stats to determine who resolves first.11 This mirrors the MTG Stack but is calculable. If my attack has Priority 5 and yours has Priority 2, I will hit you first. The bluff comes from the hidden selection.3.3 The "Gotcha" Moment vs. Strategic PlanningA core risk of hidden information in strategy games is the "Gotcha" moment—where a player loses a unit to a trap they couldn't foresee. Snippets suggest that good bluffing games (like Sheriff of Nottingham or Poker) rely on deduction, not random surprises.13Deduction: "He has 3 Gold left; he can afford the 'Fireball' tactic. I should spread my units."Randomness: "He drew the one-of-a-kind 'Meteor' card that I didn't know existed."To maintain the "Chess" metaphor of Castles, the hidden information must be deductive. The opponent should know what tactics you have available, just not when you will use them.3.4 Implementation Strategy: The Hand of TacticsWe propose a "Hand of Tactics" system that fuses MTG’s Flash with BattleCON’s cycle.3.4.1 The Tactics DeckAt the start of the match, players select a fixed hand of 5-7 Tactic Cards (open decklist). These cards do not replenish randomly; they cycle. Once played, a card goes to a "Cooldown" pile for 2-3 turns before returning to hand.15Example Cards:Ambush (Flash Creature): Spawn a unit in a forest hex if an enemy enters.Feint (Instant): Negate the next attack against target unit; attacker retreats 1 hex.Forced March (Sorcery): Move a unit a second time.3.4.2 The Stance System (The Flash Mechanic)Instead of an interrupt system (which is clunky in browsers), Castles should use a "Stance" or "Trap" mechanic.Setting the Bluff: During their turn, a player can place a Tactic Card face-down on a specific Unit or Hex. This costs "Focus" (Mana).The Trigger: If the specific condition is met (e.g., "Unit is attacked," "Enemy enters hex"), the card is revealed and resolves immediately (Flash speed).The Feint: A player can slot a "Null" card (or a basic resource card) face-down. The opponent sees the hidden card and assumes it is a trap, playing cautiously (MTG Open Mana psychology). If they avoid attacking, the bluff succeeded.This system satisfies the requirement for "Hidden Info" and "Bluffing" while remaining deterministic enough for a strategy game. The opponent knows you have the Ambush card; they just don't know if that specific face-down card is the Ambush card.4. Logistics as Balance: Adapting Burning BannersThe third objective addresses the "Snowball Effect" inherent in wargames. If capturing Castles provides Gold, and Gold buys Units, the winner inevitably gains more power, rendering the late game a foregone conclusion. Burning Banners and Command & Colors offer a solution via Activation Limits.4.1 The Friction of CommandIn Burning Banners, a player controls a vast army, but the ability to move that army is constrained by the "Season" and "Command" mechanics.16 The game features distinct factions with different activation styles, but universally, you cannot do everything at once.Activation Constraints: Snippets regarding Command & Colors describe the "Section Card" system (e.g., "Order 3 Units Left Flank").18 This creates a "Fog of War of Command." You may have a superior force on the right flank, but if you lack the cards to order them, they stand idle. This prevents a superior force from perfectly optimizing every turn.4.2 The Economics of RevoltBurning Banners introduces the concept of "Revolt" and "Upkeep".20 As an empire grows, the cost to maintain it rises. If a faction expands too quickly without the "Gold" to pay for the "Season," units revolt or become ineffective.Insight: This is a negative feedback loop (Rubber Band) that feels thematic rather than artificial. In Castles, as a player captures more territory, their "Supply Lines" should stretch, making coordination more difficult.4.3 Preventing the DeathballAnalysis of RTS snowballing 21 highlights that "Deathballs" (clumped super-armies) ruin strategy. Solutions include:Diminishing Returns: Two tanks are not twice as effective as one if they block each other's movement.23Map Sprawl: As you expand, the distance between defensible points grows, requiring you to split your forces.214.4 Implementation Strategy: Empire Sprawl & Command EconomyTo prevent snowballing in Castles, we propose decoupling Unit Ownership from Unit Activation.4.4.1 The Logistics LimitPlayers have a "Command Capacity" resource that refreshes each turn.Move Cost: Moving a unit costs 1 Command.Attack Cost: Attacking costs 2 Command.Sprawl Penalty: Each captured Castle reduces your maximum Command Capacity or increases the cost of actions (simulating bureaucratic bloat).The Snowball Reversal:Player A (Winning): Controls 3 Castles. Has high Gold income and 20 Units. However, due to "Sprawl," they only have 10 Command Points per turn. They can only move a small fraction of their army. Their forces are a sluggish, defensive wall.Player B (Losing): Controls 1 Castle. Has low Gold and 8 Units. However, they have "Home Field Advantage" (short supply lines) and 15 Command Points. They can move and attack with almost their entire army every turn.This dynamic creates an asymmetric late game. The giant (Winner) must defend against the agile underdog (Loser), giving the losing player a genuine strategic path to victory via maneuvering, satisfying the "Retention" requirement by keeping the game competitive.5. Sensory Feedback: The Science of "Juice"The final pillar of retention is "Game Feel." Strategy games often suffer from "dryness" where actions feel like spreadsheet entries. Hearthstone and Duelyst prove that audio-visual fidelity can transform a card game into a visceral combat experience.5.1 Hearthstone: The Physicality of the DigitalHearthstone is built in Unity, utilizing 3D assets to simulate a physical board.24The Box Metaphor: The game feels like a physical box of treasures. Cards are not UI elements; they are 3D objects with thickness and physics.25Impact: When a heavy minion attacks, it physically slams into the target. The camera (orthographic) shakes, and particle emitters (dust, wood chips) trigger at the point of impact.27Big Dealness: Legendary cards feature unique entrance animations (Vignettes, Stingers) that interrupt the flow to signal importance. This hierarchy of effects helps readability—players instantly know a major threat has arrived.275.2 Duelyst: High-Fidelity Pixel ArtDuelyst bridges the gap between retro aesthetics and modern VFX.Lighting: Pixel art sprites use "Emissive Maps" (glow) that interact with the game's 3D lighting engine (Bloom).28 This makes magical attacks feel hot and energetic.Animation Principles: Attacks use "Smear Frames" to convey velocity. The animation is not just movement; it is anticipation, impact (smear), and follow-through.28Hit Stop: Snippets on melee combat 30 emphasize "Hit Stop" (freezing the frame for ~100ms on impact) as crucial for selling weight.5.3 The Audio LandscapeSound design is 50% of the "Juice."Layering: A heavy hit is not one sound. It is a transient (Click/Crack for definition), a Body (Thud/Clang for character), and a Tail (Sub-bass/Reverb for weight).32Spatial Audio: Even in a 2D/2.5D game, panning the audio left/right based on board position increases immersion.345.4 Implementation Strategy: The Juice MenuFor Castles, we propose three distinct tiers of feedback.5.4.1 Juice Menu Item 1: The "Heavy Strike" (Combat)Visual:Anticipation: 4-6 frames of wind-up. Sprite scales X-axis (squash/stretch).35Impact: 1-2 frames of exaggerated Smear.Freeze: Game logic pauses for 120ms upon contact.Shake: High-frequency, low-amplitude translational shake (avoid rotation to prevent nausea).36Particles: Directional debris (blood/sparks) ejecting opposite to the attack vector.Audio: Layered "Anvil" sound. Metallic transient + 80Hz sine wave drop (Sub) + localized reverb.5.4.2 Juice Menu Item 2: The "Sanctuary Awakening" (Objective)Visual:Pulse: A rhythmic "Bloom" effect on the hex border that syncs with the game music bpm.Capture: A "Shockwave" distortion shader (refracting grid lines) expanding from the hex center.37Color Grading: The hex tint shifts from Neutral Grey to Player Color (Gold/Purple) with an additive blend mode.Audio: A "Shepard Tone" (illusion of infinitely rising pitch) that resolves into a major chord chime when captured.255.4.3 Juice Menu Item 3: The "Tactic Reveal" (Bluff)Visual:Flip: The face-down card rotates on the Y-axis.Vignette: The rest of the board darkens (70% opacity black overlay).Spotlight: A "God Ray" particle system illuminates the revealed card.Phantom: A translucent "Ghost" sprite performs the action (e.g., the counter-attack), suggesting supernatural speed.Audio: A "Reverse Cymbal" swell (sucking sound) leading into a sharp "Whip Crack" snap.6. The Synthesis: Fusion Concepts for Project "Castles"The final objective is to merge the Hex-Grid context with these researched mechanics into three cohesive "Fusion Concepts."6.1 Fusion Concept 1: The "Siege of Whispers" (Board Tension)Core Mechanic: The Sanctuary Auction.Mechanism: Sanctuaries are not captured by mere presence. They function as Dune-style conflict zones. When a unit ends its turn on a Sanctuary, it does not gain the buff immediately. Instead, it begins "Sieging."The Hook:Each turn, players can commit "Tactic Cards" face-down to the Sanctuary (Bidding).Opponents can see how many cards are committed but not what they are.At the end of a 3-turn cycle, the Siege resolves.Card Values: Some cards add "Siege Strength" (value 1-5). Others are "Sabotage" (destroy opponent's highest card).Result: This creates the Dune tension. Do I commit my best cards to the Sanctuary to win the "Dragon Summon" (1st Prize), or do I save them for my Castle defense? The "Runner Up" gets a refund on their committed cards, preventing frustration.6.2 Fusion Concept 2: The "Phantom Front" (Hidden Info)Core Mechanic: Stance Tokens via the Hand of Tactics.Mechanism: Every unit on the hex grid has a "Stance Slot."The Hook: At the start of the turn, players can slot a Tactic Card from their hand into a unit's Stance.Aggressive Stance: The unit gains +Attack but -Defense.Ambush Stance (Flash): If an enemy moves into an adjacent hex, this unit immediately attacks (interrupt).Feint Stance (Bluff): A dummy card. If revealed, it returns to hand and the unit gains a small speed boost next turn.Result: This integrates MTG/BattleCON bluffing directly onto the tactical map. Seeing a unit with a face-down Stance creates a "Zone of Danger." The opponent must deduce: "He's protecting his Monarch; it's probably a Counter-Attack stance. I should use ranged attacks."6.3 Fusion Concept 3: The "Logistics Chain" (Snowball Prevention)Core Mechanic: Dynamic Command Points linked to Empire Sprawl.Mechanism:Command Deck: Players draw a hand of "Command Cards" each turn (e.g., "Flank Advance," "Hold the Line," "General Charge"). These are required to activate units (Burning Banners style).Sprawl:1 Castle: Hand Size = 5. (High tactical flexibility).2 Castles: Hand Size = 4.3 Castles: Hand Size = 3.The Hook: The winning player (3 Castles) has massive resources (Gold/Units) but is "command starved." They can only issue 3 orders per turn, making their army clumsy. The losing player (1 Castle) has limited units but "tactical superiority" (5 orders), allowing them to outmaneuver the giant.Result: This solves the snowball problem naturally. The game shifts phases: Early game is about expansion; late game is about holding a fracturing empire against a nimble insurgency.7. ConclusionProject "Castles" has the potential to redefine the browser-based wargame by pivoting away from pure calculation and embracing the messy, emotional engagement of hybrid strategy. The research confirms that retention is not a product of perfect balance, but of meaningful tension.By implementing the Sanctuary Auction (Dune), the Phantom Front Stance System (MTG/BattleCON), and the Logistics Chain (Burning Banners), "Castles" will force players to constantly evaluate opportunity costs, bluff their intentions, and adapt to shifting logistical constraints. Coupled with a Juice profile that emphasizes the physical weight of digital actions, the game will deliver the intellectual satisfaction of Chess with the adrenaline of a poker hand.Recommendation: Prioritize the Phantom Front prototype. It is the most direct application of the "Hook" (Psychological Stickiness) to the core "Chess" metaphor, instantly transforming the board from a puzzle into a battlefield of minds.
