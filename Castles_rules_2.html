  This is a fantasy chess-like game based on the book
  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34673711-the-ember-blade"
    >The ember blade</a
  >, by Chris Wooding. Below are the details of the game, including the win
  condition, board setup, pieces, and turn phases.

<h2 id="general-rundown">General Rundown</h2>
<p>The following is an excerpt from the book that describes the game:</p>
<p>
  &quot;The hexagonal board was divided into hundreds of smaller hexes, across
  which dozens of carved pieces were scattered, some of ivory and some of
  polished black stone. The castles which gave the game its name were unevenly
  placed around the board. The object was to capture and hold them while
  protecting your king. A broken line of blue counters, representing a river and
  its fords, meandered between them.&quot;
</p>
<p>
  Within the game each player controls a set of unique pieces with different
  strengths, movement patterns, and abilities. The objective is to capture the
  opponent&#39;s Monarch or control the board by capturing their opponents
  castles.
</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="turn-phases">Turn Phases</h2>
<p>The game proceeds in turns, each turn is divided into three phases:</p>
<h3 id="movement-phase">Movement Phase</h3>
<p>
  During the movement phase, players can move up to two of their pieces
  according to their movement patterns. Pieces can move to any legal hex that is
  not occupied by another piece or blocked by an obstacle.
</p>
<h3 id="attack-phase">Attack Phase</h3>
<p>
  During the attack phase, players can use up to two of their pieces to attack
  opponent pieces within their attack range. If the sum of the strength of the
  attacking pieces exceed the strength of the piece that is attacked, the
  attacked piece is captured. Pieces can capture opponent pieces by moving into
  their hex or attacking from a distance.
</p>
<h3 id="castles-phase">Castles Phase</h3>
<p>
  During the castles phase, players can control castles by moving their pieces
  into castle hexes. In the castles phase, the active player can summon
  reinforcements by placing a new piece on an unoccupied hex adjacent to each
  controlled castle. The piece summoned from a controlled castle is initially a
  Swordsman, than an Archer, Knight, Eagle, Giant, Trebuchet, Assassin, Dragon,
  and Monarch.
</p>
<h2 id="win-condition">Win Condition</h2>
<p>The game can be won in two ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Capturing the Opponent&#39;s Monarch</strong>: If a player captures
    all their opponent&#39;s Monarchs (there may be multiple if one is summoned
    from a castle), they win the game.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Controlling the Opponent&#39;s Castles</strong>: If a player
    controls all their opponents castles, they win the game.
  </li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-board">The Board</h2>
<p>
  The board is a hexagonal grid with sides of length 8 and with various types of
  hexes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Normal Hexes</strong>: Regular hexes where pieces can move and
    capture.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>River Hexes</strong>: Hexes that act as obstacles and cannot be
    occupied by pieces. Pieces with flying may cross the river.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Castle Hexes</strong>: Key positions on the board located in the 6
    corners of the board. Each player has three castles. Control of enemy&#39;s
    castles provides special advantages as well as being a win condition.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-pieces">The Pieces</h2>
<p>
  Each player starts with the following pieces arranged on their side of the
  board. Each piece has unique attributes, including strength, type, movement,
  capture abilities, and coronation rules.

  The strength of a piece determines its ability to withstand attacks. Pieces
  with higher strength are harder to capture. The three castles are positioned
  in the corners of each player&#39;s side.
</p>
<h3 id="movement">Movement</h3>
<p>Each piece has a unique movement pattern:</p>
<h4 id="ground-units">Ground Units</h4>
<p>
  The movement of ground units is obstructed by river hexes and both friendly
  and enemy pieces.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Swordsman</strong>: Moves one forward in any direction. Can move two
    forward on its first move.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Archer,Monarch, Trebuchet</strong>: Moves one hex in any direction.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Knight</strong>: The knight can move any distance in a straight line
    if unobstructed, jumping along the edge of any hexagon to another hexagon 2
    squares away.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Giant</strong>: The giant moves any distance in a straight line if
    unobstructed, through any hex which shares an edge with its current
    position.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Assassin</strong>: Moves like the queen in chess, a combination in
    this case of the giant and knight.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="flying-units">Flying Units</h4>
<p>Flying units can move over river hexes and other pieces.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Eagle</strong>: Can fly up to 3 hexes in any direction.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dragon</strong>: Moves like a knight in chess, flying in an L-shaped
    pattern.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="heavy-units">Heavy units</h4>
<p>
  Each turn a player may move two regular units or one heavy unit. The heavy
  units are the Trebuchet, Giant, Dragon and Monarch.
</p>
<h3 id="attack">Attack</h3>
<p>
  During the attack phase, pieces up to two pieces can attack opponents within
  their attack range. The attack range of a piece is determined by its type:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Melee Units</strong>: Swordsman, Eagle, Giant, Dragon. These
      pieces capture opponent pieces by moving into their hex. The swordsman can
      only attack diagonally. The remaining melee units can attack any adjacent
      piece.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Ranged Units</strong>: Archer, Trebuchet. These pieces can attack
      opponents at an exact distance of 2 and 3 hexes respectively. When
      capturing, they do not move into the hex of the captured piece.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="combat-resolution">Combat Resolution</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple pieces can contribute to a single attack</li>
  <li>
    The total strength of attacking pieces must exceed the defender&#39;s
    strength
  </li>
  <li>Pieces fully recover between turns</li>
  <li>
    When a castle is captured new pieces can be summoned from the captured
    castle starting from the current turn.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="coronation">Coronation</h3>
<p>
  Certain pieces can be promoted or gain special abilities under specific
  conditions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Swordsman</strong>: Can be promoted to any other piece when it
    reaches the opponent&#39;s back row.
  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="game-end-conditions">Game End Conditions</h2>
<p>The game can end in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Victory</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Capturing all enemy Monarchs</li>
      <li>Controlling all enemy Castles</li>
      <li>Stalemate (opponent has no legal moves)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Draw</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mutual agreement</li>
      <li>Three-fold repetition of board position</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
