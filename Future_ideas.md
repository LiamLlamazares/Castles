# Rule changes
Currently there is the following issues:
- Swrodmen can capture forwards as a result, it is always advantageous for a swordman to wait further back and wait for their oppoenent to waste moves reaching it so that they can then trade. Stopping swordmen from capturing forwards does not seem directly possible as then the river could get easily blocked. This deincentivises forward movement and strategic complexity with structures of swordmen forming

- The starting positino is always the same which leads to some potential staleness

## Possible solutions
 - Give each player a budget of points they can spend on pieces. Players can then recruit in order pieces till they match the budget. This way fewer pieces can be placed on the board and their is more variety and swordmen are unlikely to block the rivr so we can stop them from capturing each other forwards. Dowside, with fewer pieces the game may become less strategical?
